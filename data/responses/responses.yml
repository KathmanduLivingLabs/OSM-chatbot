  utter_faq/osm_motive:
  - text: The creation and growth of OpenStreetMap have been motivated by restrictions on the use or availability of map data across much of the world. Usually, data is copyrighted and owned by Google/whoever, and sometimes data itself powering these services is not available at all or blocked by unfriendly licensing or extreme fees while the advantage of OSM is that it is always free to users and flexible.

  utter_faq/osm_data_accuracy:
  - text: OpenStreetMap is a free editable map of the whole world. It is made by people like you. This means the database will always be subject to the whims, experimentation, and mistakes of the community; this is precisely OSM's strength since, among other things, it allows our data to quickly accommodate changes in the physical world. OpenStreetMap follows wiki-style process. The essence of a wiki-style process is that all users have a stake in having accurate data. If one person puts in inaccurate data or deletes accurate data, maliciously or accidentally, the other 99.9% of people can check it, fix it, or get rid of it. There is also an error reporting mechanism on OpenStreetMap. For more info about reporting errors visit https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Error_reporting.

      Did you know?
      The OSM community and others interested in free geodata gather once a year at The State of Map Conference. That‚Äôs where new ideas and initiatives, uses and updates are presented.
  - text: |-
      Did you know?
      The OSM map database is enhanced by individuals around the world. Some find it fun and rewarding and consider it a hobby. Others simply want a great map of an area that is important to them. Still other offer help in times of crisis, such as earthquakes and tsunamis.
  - text: |-
      Did you know?
      The name of the project is OpenStreetMap; the single word refers to a single database covering the entire world. It‚Äôs sometimes erroneously referred to as Open Street Map or OpenStreetMaps.

      Did you know?
      The OpenStreetMap Foundation manages and supports the effort but does not control or direct, OSM. OSMF is an international not-for-profit dedicated to encouraging the growth, development and distribution of free geospatial data and to providing geospatial data for anyone to use and share.
  - text: |-
      Did you know?
      OpenStreetMap (OSM) is perhaps one of the largest geospatial collaborative projects in the world, where over 1.5 million contributors have helped to edit over 1 billion features. The project effectively tries to map the world using a crowdsourcing, collaborative method.
  - text: |-
      Did you know?
      The idea of creating OSM was inspired by Wikipedia, using a similar community-centric contribution approach where users can simply edit, add, or submit changes to contribute to a region in the world. Since then, the project has not only grown but has also become essential to a variety of efforts, including humanitarian workers, private companies, and a wider geospatial community.
  - text: |-
      Did you know?
      One benefit of OSM is the data are not only free but using an Open Data Commons Open Database License (ODbL) data license you can do whatever you want with the data, so there is an incentive to use and adapt the data to different purposes, which is perhaps why we are now seeing major companies such as Microsoft, Uber, Lyfe, and Apple contribute to OSM.
  - text: |-
      Did you know?
      In OSM, there are three types of elements, which includes nodes, i.e.points, ways are lines that represent linear features such as roads and the third main type of element is a relation, which can act as a collection of nodes, ways, or even other relations defined in a membership or relationship in a given grouping.
  utter_faq/osm_satellite_image_resolution:
  - text: OpenStreetMap neither controls nor owns the satellite imagery. The Aerial Imagery is from a variety of sources that we have permission to use - Bing and Maxar are the most popular and have the largest coverage. So we cannot make or request updates.
  utter_faq/osm_download_data:
  - text: |-
      There are two ways you can get data out of the OSM database. One is by using Overpass, a separate API with a powerful query language. The second is to download the OpenStreetMap data dump and filter it according to your needs.
      If you wanty to download or share map instead of data, use the 'Share' button on [openstreetmap.org](https://opestreetmap.org) (currently on bottom right corner) to download in PNG, JPEG, SVG or PDF format.
